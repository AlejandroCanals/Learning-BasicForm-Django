# JavaScript Integration Exercise with Django

In this repository, I have completed a hands-on exercise that demonstrates the integration of JavaScript with the Django web development framework. The exercise is based on content from a Coursera course on Full Stack web development from META, specifically week 3, titled "Fetching data using JavaScript".

Goal of the Exercise:** **Objective of the Exercise:**

The main objective of this exercise is to show how JavaScript can be used in conjunction with Django to process a form in a web application. 
It focuses on creating a basic form with the integration of JavaScript, Python(Django) and mySQL.

Through this exercise, I have learned how to effectively integrate JavaScript into a Django application to interact with the backend and frontend of a web application. I have also gained experience in handling forms, POST requests and manipulating JSON data in the context of web development.

This repository includes the complete source code of the exercise, which may be useful as a reference for future projects that require interaction between the frontend and backend in a Django application.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a resource in your own web development projects!
